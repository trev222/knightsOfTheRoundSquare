#### Just a fun challenge I read about on Quora.
#### Here are the rules
1. Start with a grid that has even numbers. Idealy 8x8
2. Have a program randomly select a starting block on that grid
3. Then have the program move to each block once until it has visted each block only once.
4. Have it return to the start point.

#### You can view main.html for a working example (since it's in jQuery it pretty heavy)
#### If you want to try it out on your own you can download baseTemplate.html which gives you the grid and a couple other useful functions but leaves the logic entirely up to you.
