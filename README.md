#### Just a fun challenge I read about on Quora.
#### Here are the rules
1. Start with a grid that has even numbers. Idealy 8x8
2. Have a program randomly select a starting block on that grid
3. Then have the program move to each block once until it has visted each block only once.
4. Have it return to the start point.

#### You can view main.html for a working example (since it's in jQuery it pretty heavy)
#### If you want to try it out on your own you can download baseTemplate.html which gives you the grid and a couple other useful functions but leaves the logic entirely up to you.


If you see any that don't work, let me know.
Also, for fun, try to break it yourself. Be fair and give it a solvable solution though xD

Actually, if 2 or more of the start block sides are open I think it is pretty easy to break.
